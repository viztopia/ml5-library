## Description

RNN and LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks) are a type of Neural Network architecture useful for working with sequential data (like characters in text or the musical notes of a song) where the order of the that sequence matters. This class allows you run a model pre-trained on a body of text to generate new text.

You can train your own models using this tutorial or use this set of pre trained models.

## Quickstart

```js
// Create the character level generator with a pre trained model
const rnn = ml5.charRNN('models/bola침o/', modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
}

// Generate content
rnn.generate({ seed: 'the meaning of pizza is' }, (err, results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const charrnn = ml5.charRNN(model, ?callback);
```

#### Parameters
* **model**: REQUIRED. An absolute or relative path to the charRNN model files.
* **callback**: OPTIONAL. A callback to be called once the model has loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.

### Properties


***
#### .ready
> Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.
***

***
#### .state
> The current state of the model.
***

***
#### .model
> The pre-trained charRNN model.
***

***
#### .vocabSize
> The vocabulary size (or total number of possible characters).
***


### Methods


***
#### .generate()
> Generates content in a stateless manner, based on some initial text (known as a "seed"). Returns a string.

```js
charrnn.generate(options, ?callback);
```

游닌 **Inputs**

* **options**: REQUIRED. An object specifying the input parameters of seed, length and temperature. Default length is 20, temperature is 0.5 and seed is a random character from the model. The object should look like this
  ```js
  {
    seed: 'The meaning of pizza is',
    length: 20,
    temperature: 0.5,
  };
  ```
* **callback**: Optional. Function. A function to be called when the model has generated content. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has generated new content.

游닋 **Outputs**

* **Object**: Returns an object. {sample: generated,state: this.state}.

***


***
#### .predict()
> Feed a string of characters to the model state.

```js
charrnn.predict(temperature, ?callback);
```

游닌 **Inputs**
* **seed**: REQUIRED. Predict the next character based on the model's current state.
* **callback**: Optional. Function. A function to be called when the model finished adding the seed. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the prediction has been generated.

游닋 **Outputs**

* **Object**: Returns an object `{sample, probabilities}`;

***

***
#### .feed()
> Given an image, will make objects in the image disappear

```js
charrnn.feed(seed, ?callback);
```

游닌 **Inputs**
* **seed**: REQUIRED. A string to feed the charRNN model state.
* **callback**: Optional. Function.Optional. A function to be called when the model finished adding the seed. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once seed has been fed..

游닋 **Outputs**

* **Image**: Returns an image.

***

***
#### .reset()
> Reset the model state

```js
charrnn.reset();
```

游닌 **Inputs**
* none

游닋 **Outputs**

* none
