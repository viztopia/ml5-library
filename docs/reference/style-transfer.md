## Description

Style Transfer is a machine learning technique that allows to transfer the style of one image into another one. This is a two step process, first you need to train a model on one particular style and then you can apply this style to another image.

You can train your own style transfer model by following [this tutorial](https://github.com/ml5js/training-styletransfer).

This implementation is heavily based on [fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs) by [Reiichiro Nakano](https://github.com/reiinakano).
The [original TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) was developed by [Logan Engstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom)

## Quickstart

```js
// Create a new Style Transfer Instance
const style = ml5.styleTransfer('data/myModel/', modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
}
// Grab a img element and generate a new image.
style.transfer(document.getElementById("img"), function(error, result) {
  img.src = result.src;
});
```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const styletransfer = ml5.styleTransfer(model, ?callback);
// OR
const styletransfer = ml5.styleTransfer(model, ?video, ?callback);
```

#### Parameters
* **model**: The path to Style Transfer model.
* **video**: Optional. A HTML video element or a p5 video element.
* **callback**: Optional. A function to be called once the model is loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.


### Properties


***
#### .ready
> *Boolean*. Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.
***


### Methods


***
#### .transfer()
> Apply style transfer to an input.

```js
styletransfer.transfer(?callback);
// OR
styletransfer.transfer(input, ?callback);
```

ðŸ“¥ **Inputs**

* **input**: A HTML video or image element or a p5 image or video element. If no input is provided, the default is to use the video element given in the constructor.
* **callback**: Optional. A function to run once the model has made the transfer. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has made the transfer.

ðŸ“¤ **Outputs**

* **Image**: Returns an HTML img element.
