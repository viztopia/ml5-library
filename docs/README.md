# ml5.js - Friendly Machine Learning for the Web

Welcome to the ml5.js documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to get up and started with ml5.

## Getting Started {docsify-ignore}


Take a ride on the Coding Train to watch Dan Shiffman's ["A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning with ml5.js"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmznx0Q1fP0). Here Dan explains what ml5.js is and where it all comes from.

ml5.js is machine learning _for the web_ in your web browser. Through some clever and exciting advancements, the folks building [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) figured out that it is possible to use the web browser's built in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculations that would otherwise run very slowly using central processing unit (CPU). A really nice explanation of what is happening with GPUs can be found [here - Why are shaders fast?](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/). ml5 strives to make all these new developments in machine learning on the web more approachable for everyone.


### Quickstart

The fastest way to get started exploring the creative possibilities of ml5.js are to either:

1. Download a ml5.js project boilerplate. You can download a zip file here: [ml5 project boilerplate](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-boilerplate/releases). <br/> Or...
2. Open this [p5 web editor sketch with ml5.js added](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/ml5_boilerplate).
3. You can also copy and paste the cdn link to the ml5 library here:

  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.5.0/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
  ```

***
#### Quickstart: Plain JavaScript

Reference the [latest version](https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.5.0/dist/ml5.min.js) of ml5.js using a script tag in an HTML file as below:


In an **index.html** file, copy and paste the following and open up that file in your web browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Getting Started with ml5.js</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.5.0/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      // Your code will go here
      // open up your console - if everything loaded properly you should see 0.4.1
      console.log('ml5 version:', ml5.version);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Quickstart: Powered with p5.js

If you're familiar with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), ml5.js has been designed to play very nicely with p5. You can use the following boilerplate code to get started:


In an **index.html** file, copy and paste the following and open up that file in your web browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Getting Started with ml5.js</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- p5 -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.9.0/p5.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.9.0/addons/p5.dom.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.9.0/addons/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
    <!-- ml5 -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.5.0/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      // Your code will go here
      // open up your console - if everything loaded properly you should see 0.9.0
      console.log('ml5 version:', ml5.version);

      function setup() {
        createCanvas(400, 400);
      }

      function draw() {
        background(200);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
